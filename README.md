# codeQuizHw
The code hw ansers are 

"Spideriman shooting out a web and catching her but snaping her neck"
"Bane"
" 14,000,605"
"Damian Wayne"
"Thor"

I got the quiz to work by creating an array of questions while giving them id's then identifying the correct answer for each
after i called them in a function with for loops that identifyed them cleared the last thing on the page and then loaded the qustion contents
then created variables for the time and score realting the 2 and giving a time of 100 seconds making sure it falls within the guidelines of the assignment 
and then through incrimenting through on each function it will send you to the end page where you can put in your namne and see sores
then go to play again and it works and looks pretty good ;)
